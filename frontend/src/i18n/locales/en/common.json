  "what_is_eventhub": "What is EventHub?",
  "what_is_eventhub_p1": "EventHub solves a real problem: students and developers in Kazakhstan spend hours scrolling through dozens of Telegram channels, trying to find hackathons, teammates, and opportunities. Information is scattered, deadlines are missed, and great teams never form.",
  "what_is_eventhub_p2": "We aggregate every tech event from Astana Hub, university portals, and community channels into one clean feed. Then, we use AI to match you with teammates who have complementary skills, similar interests, and the right vibe. No more cold DMs. No more \"looking for a dev\" posts that go unanswered.",
  "what_is_eventhub_p3": "EventHub is the bridge between Kazakhstan's tech youth and real opportunities. Whether you're a student looking for your first hackathon team or a founder recruiting for a startup, we make it happen in minutes, not weeks.",

  "why_matters_title": "Why EventHub matters for Kazakhstan",
  "why_matters_p1": "Kazakhstan's tech ecosystem is growing fast, but it's fragmented. Students at NU don't know about hackathons at AITU. Developers in Almaty miss opportunities in Astana. Great ideas die because teams never form.",
  "why_matters_p2": "EventHub connects the dots. We unite tech youth across universities, cities, and communities. We support hackathon culture by making it easier to find teams and events. We help colleges build stronger tech communities by giving students a platform to collaborate, not just compete.",
  "why_matters_p3": "Most importantly, we reduce friction. Creating a team should take minutes, not weeks. Finding a hackathon should be one search, not fifty Telegram channels. EventHub makes Kazakhstan's tech ecosystem accessible, connected, and ready to build.",
  "faq_title": "Frequently asked questions",
  "faq_matching": "How does matching work?",
  "faq_matching_answer": "We analyze your skills, interests, experience level, and communication style. The algorithm calculates a compatibility score (0-100%) based on skill overlap, role complement, and interest alignment. Higher scores mean better team fit.",
  "faq_parsing": "How are events parsed?",
  "faq_parsing_answer": "We use automated scrapers that run every 6 hours to check university portals, Astana Hub, and community channels. Events are deduplicated, cleaned, and organized automatically. If we miss something, organizers can submit events manually.",
  "faq_privacy": "Is my data private?",
  "faq_privacy_answer": "Yes. Your resume and personal information are only visible to users you connect with. We never share your data with third parties. You control what's public on your profile.",
