# Qosyl Marketing Campaigns

## 🎯 Core Slogan
**"Your diploma gets you a job. Your team gets you a future. Find them on Qosyl."**

---

## 1. The "Pain Point" Campaign (TikTok / Instagram Reels)

### Video Concept 1: "The Telegram Nightmare"

**Visual:** Split screen.

- **Top:** A guy frantically scrolling through 10 different Telegram channels (Astana Hub, Kolesa, random chats), looking stressed. 
- **Text:** "Trying to find a hackathon in 2024."
- **Bottom:** A guy calmly scrolling Qosyl on dark mode. Clicks one button. 
- **Text:** "Finding it on Qosyl in 2025."
- **Audio:** Trending fast-paced audio vs. chill lofi.

**Caption:** Stop the doom scroll. All KZ tech events in one feed. Link in bio. #Qosyl #AstanaHub #AITU #Hackathon

### Video Concept 2: "Tinder for Devs"

**Visual:** POV of a phone screen.

- User sees a profile: "Almas, Python Dev. Skills: Django, AI."
- User hits a glowing "Invite" button.
- Cut to: Two people high-fiving (or coding together).
- **Text Overlay:** "Finally, a way to find teammates who actually reply."

**Caption:** Don't build alone. Find your squad on Qosyl. 🚀

## 2. The "Viral Text" Campaign

### Copy Option A (Short & Punchy - for Telegram Channels):

```
🚨 Stop missing deadlines.

We just launched Qosyl — the first unified event feed for Kazakhstan.

We scraped Astana Hub, NU, AITU, and 20+ other sources so you don't have to.

✅ What's inside:
• Every Hackathon & Meetup in KZ
• Teammate Search (AI Matching)
• Resume Parser

👉 Claim your profile: [Link]

P.S. Early users get the "OG Scout" badge. 🦄
```

### Copy Option B (Storytelling - for LinkedIn/Instagram Post):

```
The Solo Founder era is over.

In Kazakhstan, we have amazing talent. We have AITU devs, NU researchers, and KBTU engineers. But we are all disconnected.

We sit in different canteens and different chats.

Today, we are launching Qosyl. To break the walls between universities. To help a designer in Almaty find a backend dev in Astana. To make sure you never miss a hackathon registration again.

If you are building the future, you belong here.

## 3. Guerrilla Marketing (Offline Campus Stunts)

### The "Missing Person" Poster

**Print simple A4 papers. Black text on white paper. Tape them near elevators and canteens.**

```
MISSING: BACKEND DEVELOPER

Last Seen: Learning Python in the library.
Wanted For: Winning the nFactorial Challenge.
Reward: 50% Equity (and free pizza).

Stop looking at walls.
Find them on Qosyl.

[Big QR Code]
```

### The "Sticker Bomb" Strategy

**Print 500 high-quality stickers. Give them out for free.**

- **Design 1:** "I ship code." (with Qosyl logo small)
- **Design 2:** "Looking for Co-Founder."
- **Design 3:** Just the Qosyl Logo (make it look like a cool streetwear brand)

---

## 4. The "Launch Hook" (Gamification)

### Strategy: "The Founding 500"

**The Offer:** The first 500 users to create a complete profile (Avatar + Resume + 3 Skills) get a special "Founding Member 🚀" badge on their profile forever.

**Why it works:** Students love status. It proves they were "early" to the next big thing.

**Email/Telegram Blast for Launch Day:**

```
We are live. The first 500 profiles get the Gold Badge. 124 spots already gone. Go.
```

---

## 5. Partnerships (The "Trojan Horse")

**Pitch to Hackathon Organizers (Astana Hub / Universities):**

```
Hey [Organizer Name], instead of using a Google Form for team matching where everyone gets lost, use Qosyl.

We will create a dedicated 'Team Formation' page for your hackathon. It's free for you, and it guarantees every participant finds a team.
```

**Benefit:** The organizer forces hundreds of students to sign up for Qosyl to participate. Instant user growth.

## 📝 Tone Guidelines

**Do:** Be confident, use emojis, talk about "shipping," "building," and "winning."

**Don't:** Use corporate words like "synergy," "platform," or "solutions."
